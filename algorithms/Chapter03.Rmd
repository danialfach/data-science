## Chapter Overview
- You learn about recursion. It’s a building block for understanding later chapters in this book.
- You learn how to break a problem down into a base case and a recursive case.
- This chapter also includes a lot of pseudocode. 
- Pseudocode is a high-level description of the problem you’re trying to solve, in code.
- It’s written like code, but it’s meant to be closer to human speech.

## Recursion [1/2]

- Suppose you’re digging through your grandma’s attic and come across a mysterious locked suitcase.

![](./Chapter03-figure/recursion_01.png)

## Recursion [2/2]

- Grandma tells you that the key for the suitcase is probably in this other box.

![](./Chapter03-figure/recursion_02.png)

- This box contains more boxes, with more boxes inside those boxes. 
- The key is in a box somewhere. What’s your algorithm to search for the key?
- Think of an algorithm before you read on.

## Approach #1

Here’s one approach.

![](./Chapter03-figure/recursion_03.png)

1. Make a pile of boxes to look through.
2. Grab a box, and look through it.
3. If you find a box, add it to the pile to look through later.
4. If you find a key, you’re done!
5. Repeat.

## Approach #2

Here’s an alternate approach.

![](./Chapter03-figure/recursion_04.png)

1. Look through the box.
2. If you find a box, go to step 1.
3. If you find a key, you’re done!

## Loop vs Recursion [1/3]

- Which approach seems easier to you? 
- The first approach uses a **while loop**. 
- While the pile isn’t empty, grab a box and look through it:


```{python, eval=FALSE}
def look_for_key(main_box):
  """ This is pseudocode"""
  pile = main_box.make_a_pile_to_look_through()
  while pile is not empty:
    box = pile.grab_a_box()
    for item in box:
      if item.is_a_box():
        pile.append(item)
      elif item.is_a_key():
        print("found the key!")
```

## Loop vs Recursion [2/3]

- The second way uses **recursion**. 
- Recursion is where a function calls itself.
- Here’s the second way in pseudocode:

```{python, eval=FALSE}
def look_for_key(box):
  """ This is pseudocode"""
  for item in box:
    if item.is_a_box():
      look_for_key(item)
    elif item.is_a_key():
      print("found the key!")
```

## Loop vs Recursion [3/3]

- Both approaches accomplish the same thing, but the second approach is clearer to me. 
- Recursion is used when it makes the solution clearer.
- There’s no performance benefit to using recursion; in fact, loops are sometimes better for performance. 
- Many important algorithms use recursion, so it’s important to understand the concept.

## Base case and recursive case [1/4n]

- Because a recursive function calls itself, it’s easy to write a function incorrectly that ends up in an **infinite loop**.
- For example, suppose you want to write a function that prints a countdown, like this:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
3...2...1
```

- You can write it recursively, like so:

```{python, eval=FALSE}
def countdown(i):
  print(i)
  countdown(i-1)
```

## Base case and recursive case [2/4]

- Write out this code and run it. You’ll notice a problem: this function will run forever!

![](./Chapter03-figure/infinite_loop.png)

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
3...2...1...0...-1...-2...
```

## Base case and recursive case [3/4]

- When you write a recursive function, you have to tell it when to stop recursing. 
- That’s why every recursive function has two parts: the **base case**, and the **recursive case**. 
- The recursive case is when the function calls itself. 
- The base case is when the function doesn’t call itself again; so it doesn’t go into an infinite loop.

## Base case and recursive case [4/4]

- Let’s add a base case to the countdown function:

```{python, eval=FALSE}
def countdown(i):
  print(i)
  if i <= 0:
    # Base case
    return
  else:
    # Recursive case
    countdown(i-1)
```

- Now the function works as expected. It goes something like this.

## The stack [1/3]

- The **call stack** is an important concept in general programming, and it’s also important to understand when using recursion.
- Suppose you’re throwing a barbecue. 

![](./Chapter03-figure/bbq.png)

- You keep a todo list for the barbecue, in the form of a stack of sticky notes.

![](./Chapter03-figure/sticky_notes.png)

## The stack [2/3]

- The stack of sticky notes is simple. 
- When you insert an item, it gets added to the top of the list. 
- When you read an item, you only read the top most item, and it’s taken off the list. 
- So your todo list has only two actions: **push** (insert) and **pop** (remove and read).

![](./Chapter03-figure/stack_01.png)

## The stack [3/3]

- Let’s see the todo list in action.
- This data structure is called a **stack**. 
- The stack is a simple data structure. You’ve been using a stack this whole time without realizing it!

![](./Chapter03-figure/stack_02.png)

## The call stack [1/2]

- Your computer uses a stack internally called the **call stack**. 
- Let’s see it in action. Here’s a simple function:

```{python, eval=TRUE}
def greet(name):
  print("hello, " + name + "!")
  greet2(name)
  print("getting ready to say bye...")
  bye()
```

- This function greets you and then calls two other functions. Here are those two functions:

```{python, eval=TRUE}
def greet2(name):
  print("how are you, " + name + "?")
  
def bye():
  print("ok bye!")
```

```{python, eval=TRUE}
greet("maggie")
```

## The call stack [2/2]

- Let’s walk through what happens when you call a function.
- Suppose you call ``greet(“maggie”)``. 
- First, your computer allocates a box of memory for that function call.

![](./Chapter03-figure/call_stack_01.png)

- Now let’s use the memory. The variable name is set to “maggie”. That needs to be saved in memory.

![](./Chapter03-figure/call_stack_02.png)

- Every time you make a function call, your computer saves the values for all the variables for that call in memory like this. 
- Next, you print ``hello, maggie!`` Then you call ``greet2(“maggie”)``. Again, your computer allocates a box of memory for this function call.

![](./Chapter03-figure/call_stack_03.png)

- Your computer is using a stack for these boxes. 
- The second box is added on top of the first one. You print ``how are you, maggie?`` 
- Then you *return* from the *function call*. When this happens, the box on top of the stack gets popped off.

![](./Chapter03-figure/call_stack_04.png)

- Now the topmost box on the stack is for the ``greet`` function, which means you returned back to the ``greet`` function. 
- When you called the ``greet2`` function, the ``greet`` function was *partially completed*.
- *When you call a function from another function, the calling function is paused in a partially completed state.*
- All the values of the variables for that function are still stored in memory.
- Now that you’re done with the *greet2* function, you’re back to the *greet* function, and you pick up where you left off. 
- First you print ``getting ready to say bye...``. 
- You call the ``bye`` function.

![](./Chapter03-figure/call_stack_05.png)

- A box for that function is added to the top of the stack. Then you print ``ok bye!`` and return from the *function call*.

![](./Chapter03-figure/call_stack_06.png)

- And you’re back to the *greet* function. 
- There’s nothing else to be done, so you return from the *greet* function too. 
- This stack, used to save the variables for multiple functions, is called the **call stack**.

## Exercises (Call Stack)

Please refer to **page 45** of the textbook for exercises

## The call stack with recursion [1/2]
- Recursive functions use the call stack too! 
- Let’s look at this in action with the factorial function. 
- ``factorial(5)`` is written as $5!$, and it’s defined like this: $5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1$. 
- Similarly, ``factorial(3)`` is $3 \times 2 \times 1$. 
- Here’s a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number:

```{python, eval=TRUE}
def fact(x):
  if x == 1:
    return 1
  else:
    return x * fact(x-1)
```

```{python, eval=FALSE}
fact(3)
```

## The call stack with recursion [2/2]

- Now you call ``fact(3)``. 
- Let’s step through this call line by line and see how the stack changes. 
- Remember, the top most box in the stack tells you what call to fact you’re currently on.

![](./Chapter03-figure/factorial_04.png)
<hr/>
![](./Chapter03-figure/factorial_05.png)

- Notice that each call to ``fact`` has its own copy of ``x``. 
- You can’t access a different function’s copy of ``x``.

## Stack & Recursion [1/6]

- The stack plays a big part in recursion. 
- In the opening example, there were two approaches to find the key. 
- Here’s the first way again.

![](./Chapter03-figure/stack_recursion_01.png)

## Stack & Recursion [2/6]

- This way, you make a pile of boxes to search through, so you always know what boxes you still need to search.

![](./Chapter03-figure/stack_recursion_02.png)

## Stack & Recursion [3/6]

- But in the recursive approach, there’s no pile.

![](./Chapter03-figure/stack_recursion_03.png)

## Stack & Recursion [4/6]

- If there’s no pile, how does your algorithm know what boxes you still have to look through? 
- Here’s an example.

![](./Chapter03-figure/stack_recursion_04.png)

## Stack & Recursion [5/6]

- At this point, the call stack looks like this.

![](./Chapter03-figure/stack_recursion_05.png)

- The “pile of boxes” is saved on the stack! 
- This is a stack of half-completed function calls, each with its own half-complete list of boxes to look through. 
- Using the stack is convenient because you don’t have to keep track of a pile of boxes yourself—the stack does it for you.

## Stack & Recursion [6/6]

- Using the stack is convenient, but there’s a cost: saving all that info can take up a lot of memory. 
- Each of those function calls takes up some memory, and when your stack is too tall, that means your computer is saving information for many function calls. 
- At that point, you have two options:

    + You can rewrite your code to use a loop instead.
    + You can use something called *tail recursion*. That’s an advanced recursion topic that is out of the scope of this book. 

## Recap
- Recursion is when a function calls itself.
- Every recursive function has two cases: the base case and the recursive case.
- A stack has two operations: push and pop.
- All function calls go onto the call stack.
- The call stack can get very large, which takes up a lot of memory.
