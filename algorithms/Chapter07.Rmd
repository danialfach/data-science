## Chapter Overview

- We continue the discussion of graphs, and you learn about weighted graphs: a way to assign more or less weight to some edges.
- You learn Dijkstra’s algorithm, which lets you answer “What’s the shortest path to X?” for weighted graphs.
- You learn about cycles in graphs, where Dijkstra’s algorithm doesn’t work.

## Background [1/2]

- In the last chapter, you figured out a way to get from point A to point B.

![](./Chapter07-figure/background_01.png)

- It’s not necessarily the fastest path. 
- It’s the shortest path, because it has the least number of segments (three segments). 

## Background [2/2]

- But suppose you add travel times to those segments. Now you see that there’s a faster path.

![](./Chapter07-figure/background_02.png)

- You used breadth-first search in the last chapter. Breadth-first search will find you the path with the fewest segments (the first graph shown here). 
- What if you want the fastest path instead (the second graph)? You can do that fastest with a different algorithm called **Dijkstra’s algorithm**.

## Working with Dijkstra’s algorithm [1/3]

- Let’s see how it works with this graph.

![](Chapter07-figure/djikstra_01.png)

- Each segment has a travel time in minutes. 
- You’ll use Dijkstra’s algorithm to go from start to finish in the shortest possible time.

## Working with Dijkstra’s algorithm [2/3]

- If you ran breadth-first search on this graph, you’d get this shortest path.

![](./Chapter07-figure/djikstra_02.png)

- But that path takes 7 minutes. 
- Let’s see if you can find a path that takes less time! 

## Working with Dijkstra’s algorithm [3/3]

There are four steps to Dijkstra’s algorithm:

- Find the “cheapest” node. This is the node you can get to in the least amount of time.
- Update the costs of the neighbors of this node.
- Repeat until you’ve done this for every node in the graph.
- Calculate the final path.

## Step 1

- Find the cheapest node.
- You’re standing at the start, wondering if you should go to node A or node B. 
- How long does it take to get to each node?

![](./Chapter07-figure/step1_01.png)

- It takes 6 minutes to get to node A and 2 minutes to get to node B.
- The rest of the nodes, you don’t know yet.
- Because you don’t know how long it takes to get to the finish yet, you put down infinity (you’ll see why soon). 
- Node B is the closest node ... it’s 2 minutes away.

![](./Chapter07-figure/step1_02.png)

## Step 2

- Calculate how long it takes to get to all of node B’s neighbors by following an edge from B.

![](./Chapter07-figure/step2_01.png)

- Hey, you just found a shorter path to node A! It used to take 6 minutes to get to node A.

![](./Chapter07-figure/step2_02.png)

- But if you go through node B, there’s a path that only takes 5 minutes!

![](./Chapter07-figure/step2_03.png)

- When you find a shorter path for a neighbor of B, update its cost. In this
case, you found:

    + A shorter path to A (down from 6 minutes to 5 minutes)
    + A shorter path to the finish (down from infinity to 7 minutes)

## Step 3: Repeat! [1/2]

### Step 1 again: 
- Find the node that takes the least amount of time to get to. 
- You’re done with node B, so node A has the next smallest time estimate.

![](./Chapter07-figure/step3_01.png)


## Step 3: Repeat! [2/2]

### Step 2 again: 
- Update the costs for node A’s neighbors.

![](./Chapter07-figure/step3_02.png)

- Woo, it takes 6 minutes to get to the finish now!
- You’ve run Dijkstra’s algorithm for every node (you don’t need to run it for the finish node). 
- At this point, you know:
    
    + It takes 2 minutes to get to node B.
    + It takes 5 minutes to get to node A.
    + It takes 6 minutes to get to the finish.
    
![](./Chapter07-figure/step3_03.png)

## Step 4

- I’ll save the last step, calculating the final path, for the next section. 
- For now, I’ll just show you what the final path is.

![](./Chapter07-figure/step4_01.png)

- Breadth-first search wouldn’t have found this as the shortest path, because it has three segments. 
- And there’s a way to get from the start to the finish in two segments.

![](./Chapter07-figure/step4_02.png)

## Recap: Dijkstra’s algorithm [1/2]

- In the last chapter, you used breadth-first search to find the shortest path between two points. 
- Back then, “shortest path” meant the path with the fewest segments. 
- But in Dijkstra’s algorithm, you assign a number or weight to each segment. 
- Then Dijkstra’s algorithm finds the path with the smallest total weight.

![](./Chapter07-figure/djikstra_vs_bfs.png)

## Recap: Dijkstra’s algorithm [2/2]

To recap, Dijkstra’s algorithm has four steps:

- Find the cheapest node. This is the node you can get to in the least amount of time.
- Check whether there’s a cheaper path to the neighbors of this node. If so, update their costs.
- Repeat until you’ve done this for every node in the graph.
- Calculate the final path. (Coming up in the next section!)

## Terminology [1/7]

- When you work with Dijkstra’s algorithm, each edge in the graph has a number associated with it. 
- These are called **weights**.

![](./Chapter07-figure/terminology_01.png)

## Terminology [2/7]

- A graph with weights is called a **weighted graph**. 
- A graph without weights is called an **unweighted graph**.

![](./Chapter07-figure/terminology_02.png)

- To calculate the shortest path in an **unweighted graph**, use **breadth-first search**. 
- To calculate the shortest path in a **weighted graph**, use **Dijkstra’s algorithm**.

## Terminology [3/7]

- Graphs can also have cycles. A cycle looks like this:

![](./Chapter07-figure/terminology_03.png)

- It means you can start at a node, travel around, and end up at the same node. 

## Terminology [4/7]

- Suppose you’re trying to find the shortest path in this graph that has a cycle.

![](./Chapter07-figure/terminology_04.png)

- Would it make sense to follow the cycle? Well, you can use the path that avoids the cycle.

![](./Chapter07-figure/terminology_05.png)

## Terminology [5/7]

- Or you can follow the cycle.

![](./Chapter07-figure/terminology_06.png)

- You end up at node A either way, but the cycle adds more weight. 

## Terminology [6/7]

- You could even follow the cycle twice if you wanted.

![](./Chapter07-figure/terminology_07.png)

- But every time you follow the cycle, you’re just adding 8 to the total weight. 
- So following the cycle will never give you the shortest path.

## Terminology [7/7]

- Finally, remember our conversation about **directed** versus **undirected** graphs from chapter 6?

![](./Chapter07-figure/terminology_08.png)

- An undirected graph means that both nodes point to each other. That’s a **cycle**!

![](./Chapter07-figure/terminology_09.png)

- With an undirected graph, each edge adds another cycle.
- Dijkstra’s algorithm only works with **directed acyclic graphs**, called **DAGs** for short.

## Trading for a piano [1/6]

- Enough terminology, let’s look at another example! This is Rama.
- Rama is trying to trade a music book for a piano.

![](./Chapter07-figure/piano_trading_01.png)

## Trading for a piano [2/6]

- “I’ll give you this poster for your book,” says Alex. “It’s a poster of my favorite band, Destroyer. Or I’ll give you this rare LP of Rick Astley for your book and $5 more.” 
- “Ooh, I’ve heard that LP has a really great song,” says Amy. “I’ll trade you my guitar or drum set for the poster or the LP.”
- “I’ve been meaning to get into guitar!” exclaims Beethoven. “Hey, I’ll trade you my piano for either of Amy’s things.”

![](./Chapter07-figure/piano_trading_02.png)

## Trading for a piano [3/6]

- Perfect! With a little bit of money, Rama can trade his way from a piano book to a real piano. 
- Now he just needs to figure out how to spend the least amount of money to make those trades. 
- Let’s graph out what he’s been offered.

![](./Chapter07-figure/piano_trading_03.png)

## Trading for a piano [4/6]

- In this graph, the nodes are all the items Rama can trade for. 
- The weights on the edges are the amount of money he would have to pay to make the trade. 
- So he can trade the poster for the guitar for \$30, or trade the LP for the guitar for \$15. 
- How is Rama going to figure out the path from the book to the piano where he spends the least dough?
- Dijkstra’s algorithm to the rescue! Remember, Dijkstra’s algorithm has four steps. 
- In this example, you’ll do all four steps, so you’ll calculate the final path at the end, too.

## Trading for a piano [5/6]

- Before you start, you need some setup. 
- Make a table of the cost for each node. 
- The cost of a node is how expensive it is to get to.

![](./Chapter07-figure/piano_trading_04.png)

- You’ll keep updating this table as the algorithm goes on. 

## Trading for a piano [6/6]

-To calculate the final path, you also need a parent column on this table.

![](./Chapter07-figure/piano_trading_05.png)

- I’ll show you how this column works soon. Let’s start the algorithm.

## Step 1: Find the cheapest node [1/3]

- In this case, the poster is the cheapest trade, at $0. 
- Is there a cheaper way to trade for the poster? This is a really important point, so think about it. 
- Can you see a series of trades that will get Rama the poster for less than $0? Read on when you’re ready. 
- Answer: No. Because the poster is the cheapest node Rama can get to, there’s no way to make it any cheaper. 

## Step 1: Find the cheapest node [2/3]

- Here’s a different way to look at it. Suppose you’re traveling from home to work.

![](./Chapter07-figure/piano_trading_06.png)

- If you take the path toward the school, that takes 2 minutes. 
- If you take the path toward the park, that takes 6 minutes. 
- Is there any way you can take the path toward the park, and end up at the school, in less than 2 minutes? 
- It’s impossible, because it takes longer than 2 minutes just to get to the park. 

## Step 1: Find the cheapest node [3/3]

- On the other hand, can you find a faster path to the park? Yup.

![](./Chapter07-figure/piano_trading_07.png)

- This is the key idea behind Dijkstra’s algorithm: Look at the cheapest node on your graph. 
- There is no cheaper way to get to this node!
- Back to the music example. The poster is the cheapest trade.

## Step 2: Figure out the cost [1/2]

- Figure out how long it takes to get to its neighbors (the cost) 

![](./Chapter07-figure/piano_trading_08.png)

- You have prices for the bass guitar and the drum set in the table. 
- Their value was set when you went through the poster, so the poster gets set as their parent.


## Step 2: Figure out the cost [2/2]

- That means, to get to the bass guitar, you follow the edge from the poster, and the same for the drums.

![](./Chapter07-figure/piano_trading_09.png)

## Step 3: Repeat [1/3]

### Step 1 again: The LP is the next cheapest node at $5.

### Step 2 again: Update the values of all of its neighbors.

![](./Chapter07-figure/piano_trading_10.png)

- Hey, you updated the price of both the drums and the guitar! 
- That means it’s cheaper to get to the drums and guitar by following the edge from the LP. 
- So you set the LP as the new parent for both instruments.

## Step 3: Repeat [2/3]

- The bass guitar is the next cheapest item. Update its neighbors.

![](./Chapter07-figure/piano_trading_11.png)

- Ok, you finally have a price for the piano, by trading the guitar for the piano. 
- So you set the guitar as the parent. 

## Step 3: Repeat [3/3]

- Finally, the last node, the drum set.

![](./Chapter07-figure/piano_trading_12.png)

- Rama can get the piano even cheaper by trading the drum set for the piano instead. 
- So the cheapest set of trades will cost Rama $35.

## Step 4: Calculate the final path [1/4]

- Now, as I promised, you need to figure out the path. 
- So far, you know that the shortest path costs $35, but how do you figure out the path? 
- To start with, look at the parent for piano.

![](./Chapter07-figure/piano_trading_13.png)

- The piano has drums as its parent. 
- That means Rama trades the drums for the piano. 
- So you follow this edge.

## Step 4: Calculate the final path [2/4]

- Let’s see how you’d follow the edges. Piano has drums as its parent.

![](./Chapter07-figure/piano_trading_14.png)

- And drums has the LP as its parent.

![](./Chapter07-figure/piano_trading_15.png)

- So Rama will trade the LP for the drums. And of course, he’ll trade the book for the LP. 

## Step 4: Calculate the final path [3/4]

- By following the parents backward, you now have the complete path.

![](./Chapter07-figure/piano_trading_16.png)

- Here’s the series of trades Rama needs to make.

![](./Chapter07-figure/piano_trading_17.png)

## Step 4: Calculate the final path [4/4]

- So far, I’ve been using the term shortest path pretty literally: calculating the shortest path between two locations or between two people. 
- I hope this example showed you that the shortest path doesn’t have to be about physical distance. 
- It can be about minimizing something. In this case, Rama wanted to minimize the amount of money he spent.
- Thanks, Dijkstra!

## Negative-weight edges [1/9]

- In the trading example, Alex offered to trade the book for two items.

![](./Chapter07-figure/negative_weight_edge_01.png)

## Negative-weight edges [2/9]

- Suppose Sarah offers to trade the LP for the poster, and she’ll give Rama an additional $7. 
- It doesn’t cost Rama anything to make this trade; instead, he gets $7 back.
- How would you show this on the graph?

![](./Chapter07-figure/negative_weight_edge_02.png)

## Negative-weight edges [3/9]

- The edge from the LP to the poster has a negative weight! 
- Rama gets $7 back if he makes that trade. 
- Now Rama has two ways to get to the poster.

![](./Chapter07-figure/negative_weight_edge_03.png)

## Negative-weight edges [4/9]

- So it makes sense to do the second trade—Rama gets $2 back that way!
- Now, if you remember, Rama can trade the poster for the drums. 
- There are two paths he could take.

![](./Chapter07-figure/negative_weight_edge_04.png)

- The second path costs him $2 less, so he should take that path, right? Well, guess what? 
- If you run Dijkstra’s algorithm on this graph, Rama will take the wrong path. He’ll take the longer path. 

## Negative-weight edges [5/9]

- You can’t use Dijkstra’s algorithm if you have negative-weight edges. 
- Negative-weight edges break the algorithm. 
- Let’s see what happens when you run Dijkstra’s algorithm on this. 
- First, make the table of costs.

![](./Chapter07-figure/negative_weight_edge_05.png)

## Negative-weight edges [6/9]

- Next, find the lowest-cost node, and update the costs for its neighbors.
- In this case, the poster is the lowest-cost node. 
- So, according to Dijkstra’s algorithm, there is no cheaper way to get to the poster than paying $0 (you know that’s wrong!).  
- Anyway, let’s update the costs for its neighbors.

![](./Chapter07-figure/negative_weight_edge_06.png)

- Ok, the drums have a cost of $35 now.

## Negative-weight edges [7/9]

- Let’s get the next-cheapest node that hasn’t already been processed.

![](./Chapter07-figure/negative_weight_edge_07.png)

- Update the costs for its neighbors.

![](./Chapter07-figure/negative_weight_edge_08.png)


- You already processed the poster node, but you’re updating the cost for it. 

## Negative-weight edges [8/9]

- This is a big red flag. Once you process a node, it means there’s no cheaper way to get to that node. 
- But you just found a cheaper way to the poster! Drums doesn’t have any neighbors, so that’s the end of the algorithm. 
- Here are the final costs.

![](./Chapter07-figure/negative_weight_edge_09.png)

- It costs $35 to get to the drums. 
- You know that there’s a path that costs only $33, but Dijkstra’s algorithm didn’t find it. 

## Negative-weight edges [9/9]

- Dijkstra’s algorithm assumed that because you were processing the poster node, there was no faster way to get to that node. 
- That assumption only works if you have no negative-weight edges. 
- So you can’t use negative-weight edges with Dijkstra’s algorithm. 
- If you want to find the shortest path in a graph that has negative-weight edges, there’s an algorithm for that! It’s called the **Bellman-Ford algorithm**. 
- Bellman-Ford is out of the scope of this book, but you can find some great explanations online.

## Implementation [1/21]

- Let’s see how to implement Dijkstra’s algorithm in code. Here’s the graph I’ll use for the example.

![](./Chapter07-figure/implementation_01.png)

- To code this example, you’ll need three hash tables.

![](./Chapter07-figure/implementation_02.png)

## Implementation [2/21]

- You’ll update the costs and parents hash tables as the algorithm progresses. 
- First, you need to implement the graph. You’ll use a hash table like you did in chapter 6:

```{python, eval=TRUE}
graph = {}
```

- But this time, you need to store the neighbors and the cost for getting to that neighbor. 
- For example, Start has two neighbors, A and B.

![](./Chapter07-figure/implementation_03.png)

## Implementation [3/21]

- How do you represent the weights of those edges? 
- Why not just use another hash table?

```{python, eval=TRUE}
graph['start'] = {}
graph['start']['a'] = 6
graph['start']['b'] = 2
```

![](./Chapter07-figure/implementation_04.png)

## Implementation [4/21]

- So ``graph[“start”]`` is a hash table. You can get all the neighbors for ``Start`` like this:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
>>> print(graph['start'].keys())
['a', 'b']
```

- There’s an edge from ``Start`` to ``A`` and an edge from ``Start`` to ``B``. 
- What if you want to find the weights of those edges?

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
>>> print(graph['start']['a'])
6
>>> print(graph['start']['b'])
2
```

## Implementation [5/21]

- Let’s add the rest of the nodes and their neighbors to the graph:

```{python, eval=TRUE}
graph['a'] = {}
graph['a']['fin'] = 1
graph['b'] = {}
graph['b']['a'] = 3
graph['b']['fin'] = 5
graph['fin'] = {}
```

- The full graph hash table looks like this:

![](./Chapter07-figure/implementation_05.png)

## Implementation [6/21]

- Next you need a hash table to store the costs for each node.

![](./Chapter07-figure/implementation_06.png)

- The cost of a node is how long it takes to get to that node from the start. 
- You know it takes 2 minutes from ``Start`` to node ``B``. 
- You know it takes 6 minutes to get to node ``A`` (although you may find a path that takes less time). 
- You don’t know how long it takes to get to the ``finish``. If you don’t know the cost yet, you put down infinity. 
- Can you represent **infinity** in Python? Turns out, you can:

```{python, eval=TRUE}
infinity = float('inf')
```

## Implementation [7/21]

- Here’s the code to make the costs table:

```{python, eval=TRUE}
infinity = float('inf')
costs = {}
costs['a'] = 6
costs['b'] = 2
costs['fin'] = infinity
```

## Implementation [8/21]

- You also need another hash table for the parents:

![](./Chapter07-figure/implementation_07.png)

- Here’s the code to make the hash table for the parents:

```{python, eval=TRUE}
parents = {}
parents['a'] = 'start'
parents['b'] = 'start'
parents['fin'] = None
```

## Implementation [9/21]

- Finally, you need an array to keep track of all the nodes you’ve already processed, because you don’t need to process a node more than once:

```{python, eval=TRUE}
processed = []
```

- That’s all the setup. 

## Implementation [10/21]

- Now let’s look at the algorithm.

![](./Chapter07-figure/implementation_08.png)

## Implementation [11/21]

- Here’s the code:

```{python, eval=FALSE}
node = find_lowest_cost_node(costs)
while node is not None:
  cost = costs[node]
  neighbors = graph[node]
  for n in neighbors.keys():
    new_cost = cost + neighbors[n]
    if costs[n] > new_cost:
      costs[n] = new_cost 
      parents[n] = node
  processed.append(node)
  node = find_lowest_cost_node(costs)
```

- That’s Dijkstra’s algorithm in Python!

## Implementation [12/21]

- Find the node with the lowest cost.

![](./Chapter07-figure/implementation_09.png)

- Get the cost and neighbors of that node.

![](./Chapter07-figure/implementation_10.png)

- Loop through the neighbors.

![](./Chapter07-figure/implementation_11.png)

## Implementation [13/21]

- Each node has a cost. 
- The cost is how long it takes to get to that node from the start. 
- Here, you’re calculating how long it would take to get to node ``A`` if you went ``Start`` > node ``B`` > node ``A``, instead of ``Start`` > node ``A``.

![](./Chapter07-figure/implementation_12.png)

## Implementation [14/21]

- Let’s compare those costs.

![](./Chapter07-figure/implementation_13.png)

- You found a shorter path to node A! Update the cost.

![](./Chapter07-figure/implementation_14.png)

- The new path goes through node B, so set B as the new parent.

![](./Chapter07-figure/implementation_15.png)

## Implementation [15/21]

- Ok, you’re back at the top of the loop. 
- The next neighbor ``for`` is the ``Finish`` node.

![](./Chapter07-figure/implementation_16.png)


- How long does it take to get to the finish if you go through node ``B``?

![](./Chapter07-figure/implementation_17.png)

- It takes 7 minutes. 

## Implementation [16/21]

- The previous cost was infinity minutes, and 7 minutes is less than that.

![](./Chapter07-figure/implementation_18.png)

- Set the new cost and the new parent for the ``Finish`` node.

![](./Chapter07-figure/implementation_19.png)


## Implementation [17/21]

- Ok, you updated the costs for all the neighbors of node B. Mark it as processed.

![](./Chapter07-figure/implementation_20.png)

- Find the next node to process.

![](./Chapter07-figure/implementation_21.png)

## Implementation [18/21]

- Get the cost and neighbors for node ``A``.

![](./Chapter07-figure/implementation_22.png)

- Node A only has one neighbor: the Finish node.

![](./Chapter07-figure/implementation_23.png)

## Implementation [19/21]

- Currently it takes 7 minutes to get to the ``Finish`` node. 
- How long would it take to get there if you went through node ``A``?

![](./Chapter07-figure/implementation_24.png)

## Implementation [20/21]

- It’s faster to get to ``Finish`` from node ``A``! Let’s update the cost and parent.

![](./Chapter07-figure/implementation_25.png)

## Implementation [21/21]

- Once you’ve processed all the nodes, the algorithm is over. 
- I hope the walkthrough helped you understand the algorithm a little better.
- Finding the lowest-cost node is pretty easy with the ``find_lowest_cost_node`` function. Here it is in code:

```{python, eval=TRUE}
def find_lowest_cost_node(costs):
  lowest_cost = float('inf')
  lowest_cost_node = None
  for node in costs:
    cost = costs[node]
    if cost < lowest_cost and node not in processed:
      lowest_cost = cost
      lowest_cost_node = node
  return lowest_cost_node
```
