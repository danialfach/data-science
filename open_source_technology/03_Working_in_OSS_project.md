# Working in OSS Project

-   Session 03

## Contributing to Open Source Software Projects

-   Investigate the project, understand its workflow and style, identify the scope and nature of your work
-   Identify how the project communicates:
    -   Review mailing lists
    -   Study archives
    -   Join an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) Channel, if one exists
-   Understand how contributions are submitted:
    -   Mailing lists
    -   Email
    -   Revision control system (e.g. git or subversion)
-   Study previous history
-   Check if the project offers veteran contributors as mentors
-   Offer your services for testing, finding bugs, etc., before you begin submitting code
-   Make sure you are competent at whatever programming or scripting language the project uses
-   Find the right balance between asking for review and suggestions early in the process, and waiting too long and dumping a lot of work on people at once
-   Be polite and respectful, and avoid obscenities, flaming and trolling

## Study and Understand the Project DNA

-   Remember that unless you are starting a new project, there will already be a community established ethos and formal or informal leadership structure
-   Ask questions:
    -   Why does this project exist and why was it started?
    -   Has it diverged far from its original purpose?
    -   Is the contributing community large or small? Continuously active or only sporadically so?
    -   Does it have a collective or singular governance structure?
    -   What kind of licenses does it adopt? Is there a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) you have to agree to?
-   Keep in mind that the majority of OSS project never really take off

## Figure Out What Itch You Want to Scratch

-   Most contributors get involved in open source projects because:
-   There is a bug/problem that interferes with their use of the project
-   They want to add additional functionality to the project
-   They want to learn something new
-   Some projects have a “janitorial” list of things to do; these relatively straightforward tasks can help you get your feet wet
-   Beginning contributors who go on to become important to a project rarely start with patches that do not affect functionality

## Identify Maintainers, Their Work and Methods

-   There are projects that have one maintainer (perhaps the benevolent dictator) or subsystem maintainers (e.g. the Linux kernel community)
-   The maintainers have to:
    -   Understand and review all submissions
    -   Make sure they add something other than complication and do not introduce bugs
    -   Make sure they don’t conflict with other patches
    -   Complete their work in a timely manner
    -   Do everything respectfully
-   Have a good relationship with relevant maintainers; be respectful and patient; offer help reviewing other contributors’ submissions, debugging new features or fixing bugs

## Get Early Input and Work In the Open

-   As a new member of the community you probably don’t know the history - your bright new idea might actually be an old one (discussed and rejected/brought to life and petered out)
-   This doesn’t mean your idea is a bad one; maybe it couldn’t have been done in the past, but is feasible now as software and hardware evolved 
-   Never just introduce an idea and suggest someone else do it 
-   Propose your ideas to the community before you go too far with it; get opinions, suggestions and input; take advantage of institutional memory
-   If you are uncomfortable having other people look at your work often, OSS is not for you!

## Contribute Incremental Bits, Not Large Code Dumps

-   Large code dumps overload maintainers and mailing lists, and make it difficult to process the individual parts
-   Code contributions are best digested in small, unit-sized bites; for example, you may have a separate patch for each file you are modifying (sequential patches)
-   It is possible that your functionality will not work until all patches are included - that’s fine

## Leave Your Ego at the Door: Don’t Be Thin-Skinned

-   OSS projects tend to attract some rather interesting characters, some of them can be quite irritating, even offensive
-   If that’s the case, rely on community members with long history to try and calm things down and resolve issues (occasionally, contributors may be purged from a project); don’t feed the trolls
-   When making criticism or engaging in any discussion thread, be polite and respect other people opinions; maybe your approach is not the best one
-   Learn when to yield if you want to get code upstream

## Do Not Discriminate or Offend

-   Do not engage in behaviors that involve discrimination and offensive conduct with respect to:
    -   Race
    -   Sex
    -   Sexual preferences
    -   Religion
    -   National origin
    -   Politics
    -   etc.
-   People from rather far sides of the spectrum often work together successfully

## Be Patient, Develop Long-Term Relationships, Be Helpful

-   Most projects do not appreciate drive by, one-time contributors, and look for long-term maintenance
-   Sometimes good code gets rejected, unless someone offers long-term commitment (think about the future when doing submissions)
-   Develop meaningful relationships in the community by offering help in areas that are not directly related to your main interests
-   Be viewed as a good citizen and real member of the community, not just someone exploiting it; this is particularly important if you are contributing as part of a commercial organization
