# Leadership vs. Control

-   Session 06
-   Adapted from The Linux Foundation Course

## Loosen the Chains

-   A good leader listens and empowers all participants to present their ideas, and contribute higher quality and imaginative work
-   Popular leadership paradigm - Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL)
    -   Can make the final decision (generally more efficiently than a majority vote or consensus of a committee),
    -   but that does not alleviate them from listening and giving proper consideration to debates in the community and even occasionally including changes and contributions they personally have problems with
-   If the controllers of a project take and do not give back by mentoring and moderating, they are limiting what a project can accomplish

## Mentoring

-   Depending on the size of the project, there may be one level of leadership or more, including subsystem maintainers whose responsibilities include:
-   Obtaining knowledge and skills necessary to become a good maintainer requires training, or more precisely mentoring, from those who have done it successfully before
-   Another level of mentoring involves new members of a project - if they can attach themselves to more experienced contributors, who may or may not be maintainers, they can learn the ropes with less pain:
    -   How to produce patches in the proper form
    -   How to phrase questions and proposals
    -   How to acquire realistic expectations of how quickly their work might be considered and whether it has a chance of success
-   Proper mentoring empowers people, leads to a more efficient workflow, and contributes to long-term vitality and growth of a project

## Building Trust

-   Without trust an open source project cannot function:
    -   Contributors must trust that their submissions will be treated with respect and givenreasonably prompt consideration
    -   Project leaders must trust subsystem maintainers are qualified and capable of doing their job;
    -   if they are not living up to their responsibilities, they can be tutored on doing abetter job or be asked to transition out of the role
-   Trust must be earned and must go beyond the benefit of the doubt
-   As a project matures, reputations are earned and new members should be aware of the history

## Why Projects Fail?

-   The vast majority of OSS projects do not succeed
-   The causes of the failure:
-   The low survival rate should not be seen as a bad thing
-   Most (but not all) successfull open source projects start small and it can be difficult to predict which ones will survive and thrive.
