# Introduction to Open Source Software

-   Session 01
-   Adapted from The Linux Foundation Course

## What is Open Source Software?

-   Please share your understanding
-   Please share your experience
    -   as user
    -   as developer

## Free Software

-   The original term is Free Software
-   Two meanings of word "Free" :
    -   not limited/controlled,
        as in freedom of speech or freedom to distribute
    -   no cost/payment
        as in free beer or free sample

## Open Source Software (OSS)

-   People began to use the term "Open Source" in 1998
-   Source code is made available with a license which provides rights to:
    -   examine
    -   modify
    -   redistribute
-   Without restriction on the userâ€™s identity or purpose

## Licensing Classifications in OSS

-   Permissive
    -   Any code changes need to be available to recipients
    -   Often prefered by companies
    -   Example: BSD License
-   Restrictive
    -   Any code changes must be available to all recipients
    -   Also known as "Copyleft"
    -   Example: GPL License

## History of OSS

-   The concept of OSS began in 1950s
    -   Softwares were distributed as source code and not as binary
    -   Softwares were bundled for free with hardware
-   1960s: UNIX was born
-   1970s: Emacs, Vi, and TeX were born
-   1980s: Usenet, GNU Project, X11, FSF, gcc (GNU Compiler Collection), Perl were born
-   Early 1990s: Linux, Vim, Python, BSD, Debian, RedHat, MySQL
-   Late 1990s: PHP, GIMP, Ruby, Apache, KDE, GNOME, OpenOffice
-   2000s: Firefox, Ubuntu, Git, Android, Chromium, Wikipedia

## Open Source Governance Models

-   Governance or organisation is needed for a project to achieve its goal
-   How decisions get made and who makes them requires careful thought
-   How this is done determines the **Governence Model** for a project

## Governance Model: Company-led

-   Software design, development, and releases are controlled by one entity
-   External contributions may or may not be solicited
-   Mostly closed process
-   Plans and release dates may not be described openly
-   Internal discussions/controversies may not be aired
-   Upon release, software is in the Open
-   Example: Google Android, Red Hat Enterprise Linux

## Governance Model: Benevolent Dictatorship

-   Strong leadership
-   One individual has overriding influence
-   Project's quality and success depend heavily on the dictator's wisdom and management capability
-   Maintainers write less and less code as projects mature
-   Can avoid endless discussion and lead to a quicker pace of development
-   Example: Linux Kernel, Python, Wikipedia

## Governance Model: Governing Board

-   Tighter control by smaller group
-   A (body) group carries out discussion on open mailing list and all decisions are made collectively
-   Decisions about who can contribute, and how patches and new softwares are accepted, are made by governing body
-   Releases are less frequent, but well-debugged
-   Example: FreeBSD, Debian
