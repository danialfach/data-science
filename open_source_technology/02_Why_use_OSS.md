# Why use OSS?

-   Session 02
-   Adapted from The Linux Foundation Course

## Advantages of OSS

-   Collaborative development
-   Security and Quality of Source Code

## Collaborative Development

-   Enables software projects to build better software
-   When progress is shared, not everyone has to solve some problems and make the same mistakes
-   Faster progress and reduced costs
-   More eyeballs viewing the code and more groups testing it which leads to robust and secure software

## Security and Quality of Source Code

-   Coding standards and styles:
    -   cleaner: it's embarassing to to show sloppy code
    -   more consistent: more people have to understand and work on the code
-   More eyeballs inspecting security vulnerabilities before they are discovered by bad people
-   More inputs in origin design and avoid bad ideas
-   No "security through obscurity"
-   No "just trust me"
-   Potentially faster bug repair

## Some of the stakeholders benefittng from OSS:

-   Users
-   Businesses
-   Education
-   Developers

## Users

-   Flexibility to mix and match software from different sources
-   Avoid vendor lock-in
-   Save money on buying or leassing software
-   Look under the hood
-   Have more fun

## Businesses: Collaborative Development

-   Lower total cost of development
-   Speed up time time to market
-   Encourages comunity feedback: criticism, suggestions, contributions
-   Uses well defined API
-   Adoption by larger community, confidence that the product is here to stay

## Businesses: Marketing

-   Customer know what they are getting, can have confidence in quality, no secrets
-   Product is seen as being part of a large ecosystem of related products
-   More flexible, possible modular construction
-   Adoption by larger community can lead to customer confidence that the product is here to stay

## Education: School and University

-   Large amount of teaching resources at little or no cost
-   Wide range of areas: operating systems, office, programming, multimedia, etc
-   Students are not locked into vendor products
-   Unleashes student creativity
-   Develop good habit (works collaboratively)
-   Be easily evaluated by prospective employers since their work is publicly available

## Developers

-   No need to re-invent everything
-   More eyeballs on code to find and fix bugs faster
-   Allows suggestions/contributions from a larger group
-   Help to find the next job
-   Builds community

## Successful OSS Projects

-   Linux Kernel
-   Git
-   Apache
-   many more...

## Linux Kernel

-   It is an OSS project since 1991
-   Initiated and lead by Linus Torvald
-   Released under GPL v2
-   Basis of most all the world's computing infrastructure:
    HPC, Android, embedded and wearable (Fitbit)

## Git

-   Created in 2005
-   First created to handle Linux kernel development
-   Most adopted distributed version control system
-   Basis of GitHub, BitBucket, Stash, GitLab, and many others

## Apache

-   Apache HTTP Server began in 1995
-   Most widely used web server
-   Released under Apache Software License (more permisive than GPL)

## Languages

-   Python, Perl, Ruby, Rust, JavaScript, etc
-   HTML5, CSS, markdown, LaTeX

## X and Desktop Managers

-   KDE, GNOME, XFCE, i3WM
