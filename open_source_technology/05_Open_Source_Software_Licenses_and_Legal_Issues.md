# Open Source Software Licenses and Legal Issues

-   Session 05
-   Adapted from The Linux Foundation Course

## Restrictive vs Permissive Licensing

-   There is an almost infinite variety of available open source licenses
-   Choice should depend on both needs and philosophy
-   Two basic categories:
    -   Restrictive licenses
        -   software remains open;
        -   strong limitations on any attempt to make proprietary closed products
        -   changes to the code available to future recipients
        -   e.g. GPL (a copyleft license)
    -   Permissive licenses
        -   don’t require modifications and enhancements to be generally available
        -   e.g. BSD and Apache licenses

## Choosing a License

-   Choosing the best license is a very important decision and requires careful thought
-   Switching to a different license later during the life of the project can be difficult if not impossible (especially, if there are many contributors with rights)

## Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD)

-   First usage of the term Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt goes back as far as the 1920s;
-   Use of the acronymic form seems to date from the 1970s
-   FUD means disseminating misinformation to influence recipients to avoid certain strategies, products or classes of products by appealing to fear
-   Microsoft was widely accused of spreading FUD about Linux in the 1990s;
-   In present day Microsoft has stopped doing so and it is actually employing OSS widely

## FUD Debunked

-   OSS is a virus
    -   One has to be careful about respecting licenses but many prominent companies heave learned how to combine open and closed software in their offerings;
    -   There are companies and organizations dedicated to helping ensure this is done properly
-   OSS infringes on software and forces you to grant patent rights to others
    -   Once again proper legal analysis is required
-   OSS products leave nowhere to turn when they break or to get technical help
    -   Many open source products are supported by serious
    -   long-living companies (such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux), as well as smaller organizations
    -   There is a lot of freely available help online
    -   There are many consultants that can be hired
    -   There is more competition available for such help than there would be with vendor lock-in on a product
-   OSS requires a lot of legal help to avoid the above pitfalls and is thus very expensive
    -   Even proprietary software requires significant legal analysis to properly avoid copyright and patent infringement, etc.
    -   OSS is no different and not more expensive, and having all the software being available in source form expedites the auditing process.

## Legal Issues

-   Companies require interaction with lawyers, either on staff or external, to make sure they do not violate copyrights and licenses
-   There are many kinds of licenses and one has to be careful, but once an organization develops proper reasonable procedures, it is just a standard part of any project
-   Part of this is training the developers to understand the dos and don’ts of working with OSS
